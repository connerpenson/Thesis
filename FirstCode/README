This code will not run prperly because the original wf000.dat and wf001.dat files are deleted.
Though, two wavefunctions are input into the cd by these names the code should run.

The purpose of this code was basicall to familiarize myself with our setup and some of the calculations that I would be interacting with
regularly. The wavefunction files were essentially arbitrary. It was for practice.

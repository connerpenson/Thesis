Virtual molecular orbitals allocation for augmentation to the
continuum orbitals.
This is required for the construction of the N+1 trial eigenkets.

0 virtual MOs of Ag symmetry retained
1 virtual MOs of B3u symmetry retained
1 virtual MOs of B2u symmetry retained
0 virtual MOs of B1g symmetry retained
0 virtual MOs of B1u symmetry retained
0 virtual MOs of B2g symmetry retained
0 virtual MOs of B3g symmetry retained
0 virtual MOs of Au symmetry retained

Scattering method employed: close coupling (CC) expansion


Continuum orbitals: orbitals which represent the scattering electron. 
A partial wave expansion of up to and including g-wave is employed (see Faure et. al. (2002)).


Number of target states employed in close coupling expansion and retained in the outer region: 10
(see SelectedTargetStates.txt in results folder for details).


R-matrix sphere radius: 11 a_0
R-matrix propagated to 100.1a_0



Assumptions of the BEB ionisation cross section calculations:

the ionisation energy of 1 is 15.283 eV by Koopman's theorem 


Q=1 for all the bound orbitals.

bound orbitals used in the computation of the BEB cross section (binding energies B and kinetic energies U
are given in eV):
